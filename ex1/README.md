# OOP-assigment-1
## this project deals with undirected weighted graph.
### this graph consist of 3 interfaces, 2 classes and inner class

#### Inner class NodeData designed to create vertices and edge  of the graph
>##### NodeData has 5 main functions:
>>###### 1 *construcor* receives integer key, create vertice with this unique key
>>###### 2 *getTag* return tag of vertice
>>###### 3 *setTag* receives real number, and set this number in tag
>>###### 4 *getInfo* return string info of vertice
>>###### 5 *setInfo* receives string, and set this string in info

#### class WGraph_DS disigned to create graph
##### data structure for this class is HashMap because each vertices has a unique key and this allows us retrieve information faster.
>##### WGraph_DS has 13 main functions:
>>###### 1 *Constructor*, creates empty graph.
>>###### 2 *getNode* receives integer, return vertice if he exist in graph.
>>###### 3 *hasEdge* receives 2 integer keys , return true if exist edge.
>>###### 4 *getEdge* receives 2 integer keys , return value of edge if exist edge else return -1.
>>###### 5 *addNode* receives integer, create vertice and adds to grap.
>>###### 6 *connect* receives 2 keys  and value of edge, connects two vertices with edge. 
>>###### 7 *getV* returns all vertice of graph.
>>###### 8 *getV* receives key of vertice and return all of its neighbors. 
>>###### 9 *removeNode* receives integer key of vertice, removes thats vertice and all edges associated with this vertex.
>>###### 10 *removeEdge* receives 2 integer keys, removes an edge between two vertices.
>>###### 11 *nodeSize* return number of vertices.
>>###### 12 *edgeSize* return number of edge. 
>>###### 13 *getMc* number of changes in graph.

#### class WGraph_Algo disigned to work with a graph
>##### WGraph_Algo has 8 main functions:
>>###### 1 *Init* method is a predefine method to initialize an object after its creation.
>>###### 2 *getGraph* return all vertices of graph.
>>###### 3 *copy* deep copy of the graph.
>>###### 4 *isConnected* retun true when graph linked, using an algorithm BFS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
>>###### 5 *shortestPathDist* receives source key and destanation key, return shortest distance of path using an algorithm(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
>>###### 6 *shortestPath* receives source key and destanation key, return shortest path using an algorithm(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
>>###### 7 *save*, return true if managed to create a file
>>###### 8 *load*, return true if managed to upload a file
